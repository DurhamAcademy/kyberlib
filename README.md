# Features

Kyberlib provides unified ESC wrappers with consistent Kotlin-style API calls. Have you ever wanted a Victor SPX to follow a Spark MAX? Now you can. Also, gone are the days of CAN IDs. Kyberlib allows you to store device IDs in a central registry, and will automatically look them up when declaring motor controllers by a device name.

Kyberlib allows for conversion between units of distance, angle, velocity, and more. All without messy function calls. For example, 4.feet.inches => 48. It also includes some useful operators, like finding the shortest route between two angles.

## More coming soon, including
- Limelight wrapper
- Automatic WPILib motion profile regeneration
- LED animation profiles using the new AddressableLED class
